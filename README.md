<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Personal website made in Flutter. Web support is not on a good usable level yet but it is getting there. 
My idea was to load markdown files from Firebase storage but that does not have Flutter web support yet.

I wanted a personal website so showcase some blogposts and personal projects. The website is also a showcase for my Flutter development.

### Built With
See the `pubspec.yaml` for versions.

* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
* [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http)
* [flutter_markdown](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_markdown)
* [fluro](https://pub.dev/packages/fluro)
* [firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To build the app locally on an emulator or to your own device, make sure you installed flutter and all its components documented [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

To test Flutter Web locally you would need to enable web support in Flutter. 

See [this official Flutter link](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web) to enable it and run it.

Unfortunatly it only work on the Google Chrome version instead of Chromium. 

### Prerequisites

* dart packages
```
pub get
```

* Install Google Chrome browser
