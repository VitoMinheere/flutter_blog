# What I've been doing to bring up my arms

1. Higher frequency

    I used to train my biceps twice a week and my triceps every 5 days. Now I train my biceps 4x a week and my triceps 2x a week. The weekly total volume is a much higher for biceps but only a bit higher for triceps, but the higher frequency alone seems to make a difference in growth.

1. Moderate and high reps

    Because biceps get plenty of heavy work from back training and because isolation moves are not very safe to do heavy, I train my biceps with reps between 8 and 16 on most occasions.

1. Strict technique

    I never cheat curl. Some people have come up with all sorts of justifications for loose technique, and all of them are ego-feeding bullshit. Also, every bicep move is full ROM. Yeah, I'm not the guy at the gym curling the most, but I often have the biggest arms.

1. Planned progression

    I keep track of the weights, reps, and sets I use. I'll design my training to periodically exceed those old values and establish higher ones. If you just 'train hard' and don't plan on pushing yourself further, it's easier to get complacent and not overload enough.

1. Exercise Variation

    I use two bicep moves 2x a week every mesocycle. Every meso (month), I pick two new bicep moves and use them the whole month. This allows for a reduction in adaptive resistance and a growth of all parts of the muscle.

1. Emphasis, De-Emphasis

    Every other mesocycle I either focus on bicep training or rear/medial delt training. I do this by training the focus bodypart earlier in each session (more energy for overload) and using volume close to MRV. The deemphasized bodypart is trained later in the session with about 2/3 MRV. This strategy allows both bodyparts to grow long term without stalling out.

1. Take pics in front of strange objects like garden hoses.

## Things that haven't worked, backfired, or gotten me hurt

- Partial ROM

- Weights heavier than 8RM

- Once a week arm days

- Cheating on technique

# Triceps Training Tips

1. The triceps are a big, strong muscle. Such a muscle can benefit greatly from heavy loading and compound or semi-compound moves. The best tricep builders in my experience are:

    - Skull Crushers

    - Overhead Barbell or EZ Extensions

    - Dips

    - Close Grip Bench and Incline Presses

    You can do all kinds of other work and should for full development, but most (maybe 2/3 on average) of your triceps work should come from those moves.

1. As is the case with all muscles, stretch under load is important. And especially in the case of the triceps, peak contraction is important too because that's often when the triceps take over the most in pressing. In addition, more motor units are recruited during full ROM lifts. If we all got paid a dollar for every tricep extension done without full stretch or lockout, we'd all be very rich, which is not a great state of affairs. Yes, full ROM and peak contraction mean less weight used. But guess what? Heavy triceps training is already taken care of during presses! Isolation work should be kept higher in reps and of course high in quality. Wanna big a big man? Incline close grip 225 for sets of 12 instead of trying to be a one-arm cable extension quarter-rep hero.

1. The MRV range for direct triceps work tends to be between 15 and 20 sets per week. Rarely over 20 because triceps are so heavily involved in pressing moves for the chest and shoulders (and the long head in pulling moves, too). So the muscle's volume tolerance is quite high, but direct work doesn't reflect nearly all the volume the triceps can handle.

1. Triceps can take a lot of damage and can take a while to heal. 2-4 weekly sessions for them are best, with very advanced lifters possibly only having one or two big triceps sessions and a second or third much easier triceps session to promote recovery/adaptation.

1. Splitting up triceps training can take many forms, but a very productive split involves alternating overhead work (oh extensions) with horizontal work (skulls) or with downward work (pushdowns, dips). This develops the whole muscle without overreaching any parts of it and works to reduce chronic injuries.

## Overhead Triceps Extension

The overhead triceps extension is my favorite triceps move... tied with barbell skull crushers. If you're looking to get bigger triceps, this move is a good start. I'd keep the reps between 8 and 20 and really make sure the elbows stay pointed as forward as possible through the movement. Full ROM as well of course.

# Biceps Training Tips

1. Barbell, EZ bar and dumbbell curls seem best, but cables can be useful at times especially for drop sets and variations.

1. Vary grips once a mesocycle (straight, EZ, hammer, etc.) but don't do any grip that hurts your wrists, shoulders or elbows even when you've played around with hand spacing.

1. You're not in high school and the other sex doesn't give a shit how much you curl, so cut out the partial reps and swinging. Curls should be done with full range of motion and as little swing as possible if you want bigger arms.

1. Most people's biceps don't take on much damage and heal very quickly, which means they should be trained more often, probably 3-6 days a week for most. Training my biceps more frequently was one of the best decisions I ever made for arm size. There should not be a 'biceps day' in your program.

1. 15-30 sets is the typical MRV for biceps, so you'll have to spread that out over 3-6 sessions. On some days you can train them earlier in the workout with more volume and intensity, on others you can train them with less volume and intensity towards the end of a workout. Using different exercises for those different days can provide excellent variation and promote recovery/adaptation while minimizing overuse injury potential.

1. You can build impressive arms by compound pulling only, but to get maximal development you should isolate the biceps with curls. Chest flies done right can also provide some eccentric loading to the biceps.

1. Many people will respond well to intensity techniques such as drop sets, ultra high rep sets and occlusion training for a metabolite stimulus. Just make sure not to overuse them and keep conventional straight sets with progressing weight in the 8-16 range for around 2/3 of your bicep training.

1. When taking pics of your biceps, make sure to do it in a bathroom no-pic zone and include folks just walking by to use the john in your pictures.

## Hammer Curl Tips

1. You already use very heavy weights in a hammer grip for most rows and pull-ups, so that's taken care of. For an isolation move like this, lighter weights will usually be the focus. This is also a bonus as it reduces injury risk and lets you really focus on quality technique.

1. A lot of people LOVE to show off on hammer curls by swinging a lot of weight around. Somehow by the grace of god I managed to get decent arms by only ever using about half the weight of all the gym heroes. My weird tricks? Using a full ROM and not swinging of course! I also like to squeeze the peak contraction, but that's mostly a personal choice I may or may not recommend to others.

1. You CAN do one arm at a time, but I like bilateral moves more in general. Your call there, just don't use it as an excuse to loosen up technique.

1. I use these as one of my two bicep moves per mesocycle pretty regularly. They are in the rotation with cable curls, barbell curls, regular dumbbell curls and EZ bar curls. I train biceps after every upper body workout, which is 4x per week, with 3-6 sets each time.

## Dumbbell Twist Curls

1. Hold dumbbells on the outer edges and begin in hammer curl position (so that your grip is around the uppermost part of the dumbbell handle).

1. As you curl, supinate your palm and let it face up (or as your flexibility allows) at the top.

1. This engages the biceps in all 3 of their main functions: forearm flexion, shoulder flexion, and supination.

1. Use weights you can control for at least 8 reps on the first set.

# Forearm Training Tips

1. The VAST majority of your forearm training will be in front of your computer, at home, by yourself. JUST KIDDING!!! (I hope). Ok seriously, the vast majority of your forearm training will come as secondary work from gripping weights during your normal heavy training, especially in pulling movements.

1. For your normal pulling training to transfer best to forearm growth, make sure you only use straps WHEN YOU NEED THEM. I see guys strapping into pulldowns, for example, and that just tells me your forearms need serious work. For heavy bent rows and deadlift variants, strap up for sure (cause you don't want to limit your back via your forearms), but for the rest, use just chalk and let your grip get some work.

1. If you choose to do direct forearm training, your MRV here will be between 10-15 sets per week in most cases. I recommend using barbell and dumbbell wrist curls (where you let the weight roll all the way down to your finger tips, then curl all the way back up to squeeze and repeat slowly) as well as grippers (Ironmind, for example) for most forearm training. Use 8-20 reps per set and do QUALITY contractions, getting a full ROM and holding peak contractions for a second or two. You don't isolate this muscle to just heave weight around... your pulling already does that.

1. Isometric holds are ok, but a.) Isometric contractions don't cause as much muscle growth as dynamic ones and b.) your pulling training already accomplishes this effect.

1. If you choose, train your forearms either the day after back training or at the end of a back session. Don't train back before your forearms have healed, or you'll interfere with the growth of both muscle groups.

1. Don't expect overnight results. Forearm growth takes a long time, and the surefire way to get big forearms is to gain weight over time and get your back stronger... the direct work is icing on the cake.
